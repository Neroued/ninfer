# NInfer

> Selected checkpoints. Maximum single-GPU inference performance. Native NVFP4 on Blackwell;
> software NVFP4 on Volta.

NInfer is a from-scratch C++/CUDA inference engine for explicitly registered Qwen checkpoints on a
single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 or Tesla V100. It runs text, image, and video prompts through a local
CLI or OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible HTTP APIs. The runtime is deliberately specialized: one GPU,
one resident model, and a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active requests.

NInfer supports five artifact identities. The quick-start commands use Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4.

| Model | Weights | Artifact | Download and model card |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_6_27b.ninfer` | [Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer) |
| Qwen3.6-27B | `nvfp4` | `qwen3_6_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` | [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer) |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_8_27b.ninfer` | [Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer) |
| Qwen3.8-27B | `nvfp4` | `qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer` | [Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer) |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | `groupwise-int` | `qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer` | [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer) |

The artifact identity fixes the exact model and weight profile. Every artifact also embeds the
tokenizer, chat template, and media frontend resources required by its registered target.

## Performance

Performance is reported separately for the RTX 5090 and Tesla V100. [Performance](docs/performance.md)
records the RTX 5090 benchmark profiles and methodology; [V100 qualification](docs/v100.md) records
the Volta methodology, complete artifact sweep, and DFlash window sweep.

### Tesla V100: software NVFP4 and groupwise inference

The Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 short-context MTP5 target round is **60.16 ms** with 5.0 licensed tokens,
or **83.10 committed tok/s**.

The single-request sweep uses the public Engine benchmark on a Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB with CUDA
12.8 and INT8 group-64 KV. Prefill is an isolated `pp2048` run; decode is `pp2048+tg256` with CUDA
Graphs and the optimized proposal head. Each result uses one discarded warmup and three measured
repetitions.

| Model profile | MTP K | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-27B `groupwise-int` | 4 | 1,131.6 | 59.70 |
| Qwen3.6-27B `nvfp4` | 5 | 235.8 | 54.71 |
| Qwen3.8-27B `groupwise-int` | 5 | 1,123.6 | 75.36 |
| Qwen3.8-27B `nvfp4` | 5 | 1,160.1 | 86.78 |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `groupwise-int` | 5 | 763.4 | 211.41 |

On Volta, NVFP4 is decoded and executed in software using tuned FP16 tensor-core and SIMT kernels.
Dense MLP gate/up payloads are prepacked in place during model load for the QPN decode layout; the
artifact on disk is unchanged and inference does not perform runtime weight repacking.

The 35B-A3B production DFlash round at a 2,048-token context uses K=3: **134.33 tok/s**, 93.3%
draft acceptance, and 3.8 mean output tokens per round over ten measured rounds after two warmups.

### Concurrent MTP3 decode

Saturated decode used INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, MTP3, and one 8,192-token generation per active
request. Values are aggregate committed decode throughput and MTP acceptance from complete
intervals whose actual decode batch equaled the configured concurrency.

| Model profile | C=1 tok/s / accept | C=2 tok/s / accept | C=4 tok/s / accept | C=8 tok/s / accept | C8 / C1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-27B `groupwise-int` | 185.8 / 68.2% | 247.0 / 69.0% | 309.5 / 68.4% | 535.0 / 68.3% | 2.88× |
| Qwen3.6-27B `nvfp4` | 202.4 / 69.3% | 399.7 / 71.4% | 699.7 / 69.3% | 1,146.9 / 68.6% | 5.67× |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `groupwise-int` | 593.0 / 67.2% | 877.7 / 68.2% | 1,166.0 / 69.8% | 1,313.8 / 67.3% | 2.22× |
| Qwen3.8-27B `nvfp4` | 143.8 / 48.9% | 267.6 / 48.1% | 461.1 / 45.8% | 766.6 / 46.0% | 5.33× |

### Single-request serving

The serial serving corpus used INT8 group-64 KV, CUDA Graphs, a 1,024-token prefill chunk, and five
fixed seeds after warm-up. The table keeps one short-prefill, one extreme-prefill, and one
structured-output MTP3 point for each published profile; the full context and scenario matrices are
in the performance document.

| Model profile | 7,680-token prefill | 260,096-token prefill | Structured MTP3 decode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B `groupwise-int` | 15,544.3 tok/s | 5,157.1 tok/s | 770.9 tok/s |
| Qwen3.6-27B `groupwise-int` | 3,218.1 tok/s | 1,614.8 tok/s | 193.0 tok/s |
| Qwen3.6-27B `nvfp4` | 11,191.5 tok/s | 2,510.6 tok/s | 252.2 tok/s |
| Qwen3.8-27B `nvfp4` | 8,340.4 tok/s | 2,203.1 tok/s | 219.8 tok/s |

## Quick start

NInfer requires 64-bit Linux, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 with CUDA Toolkit 13.1 or a Tesla V100
with CUDA Toolkit 12.8, CMake 3.28 or newer, a C++20 host compiler, Ninja, `pkg-config`, FFmpeg
development libraries (`libavformat >= 60`, `libavcodec >= 60`, `libavutil >= 58`, and
`libswscale >= 7`), and `libcurl >= 7.85`. The build accepts only `sm_120a` and `sm_70`; one binary
targets one architecture.

Build the product binaries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer.git
cd ninfer

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

For a V100, select CUDA 12.8 and Volta explicitly:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-v100 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-12.8/bin/nvcc \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=70
cmake --build build-v100 -j
```

The same five `.ninfer` artifacts and public Engine/CLI/serving routes are supported by both
builds. See the [V100 port notes](docs/v100.md) for qualification and the preferred-GPU launcher.

On Volta, loading an NVFP4 artifact repacks each dense MLP gate/up payload in place on the GPU into
the QPN fragment order used by the decode kernels. The `.ninfer` file and host-side artifact bytes
are unchanged, the device allocation remains the same size, and temporary repack storage is
released before inference. Device-resident gate/up weights are therefore deliberately mutated at
load; the V100 path does not retain checkpoint-native immutable layout for those payloads.

Tests, benchmarks, and maintainer tools are excluded from the default build. There is no install
target or packaged binary distribution; run NInfer from its source build tree.

Download the artifact used by this example with the Hugging Face CLI:

```bash
hf download neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer \
  qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --local-dir models
```

Start a long-running text/agent server with two active-request lanes and explicit Device/Host
checkpoint capacity:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Each request has a 240,000-token logical ceiling. A shared 240,000-token Device KV pool serves
admitted requests; two requests run concurrently when their combined reservations fit. The cache
tiers provide two Device checkpoint slots, eight pinned Host State slots, and 8 GiB of pinned Host
KV beyond the two active StateImages.

Send an OpenAI-style request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with one short sentence."}],
    "max_tokens": 64
  }'
```

Run a one-shot CLI request with a 32,768-token allocation:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --prompt "Explain prefill and decode, then give a concise conclusion." \
  --max-context 32768 \
  --max-new 8192 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

Answer content is written to stdout. Loading progress, reasoning, timings, throughput, memory, and
speculative-decoding statistics are written to stderr. Use `--messages FILE` and `--vision` for
structured image/video input; see the [CLI guide](docs/cli.md) and [committed examples](examples/cli/).

## Resource-aware long-context reuse

A reusable prefix checkpoint contains KV and the complete continuation state for its exact prompt
frontier. A Device-resident checkpoint resumes directly. Under pressure, the planner weighs Device
retention, pinned Host State/KV, and eviction by immediate restore work and later reuse cost. Active
requests retain their completion reservations.

See [Resource scheduling and context cache](docs/maintainer/resource-scheduling-and-context-cache.md)
for the algorithm and [Serve TTFT benchmark](tools/bench/ttft/) for public-HTTP coverage of hot
reuse, Host resume, eviction, shared prefixes, scheduling boundaries, and multimodal load.

## Evaluation

Capability scores were measured through NInfer's OpenAI-compatible serving route with thinking
enabled, MTP3, and EvalScope 1.9.0 (0-shot, rule scoring, one sample per problem):

| Model profile | AIME 2025 | AIME 2026 | GPQA-Diamond | ERQA | RealWorldQA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [Qwen3.6-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 86.67% | 93.33% | 86.87% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.6-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 93.33% | 93.33% | 84.34% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NInfer/README.md) | 90.00% | 90.00% | 85.35% | — | — |
| [Qwen3.8-27B groupwise-int](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer/README.md) | 96.67% | 96.67% | 87.37% | 66.25% | 82.22% |
| [Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4](model-cards/Qwen3.8-27B-nvfp4-NInfer/README.md) | 96.67% | 96.67% | 90.40% | 66.25% | 83.53% |

The Qwen3.6 rows used temperature 0.6 and presence penalty 1.0; the Qwen3.8 rows used temperature
1.0 and presence penalty 0.0. Multimodal evaluation used `--vision` and an 81,920-token context
limit. Text evaluation used 262,144 tokens except Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4, which used 252,928 tokens to
fit the RTX 5090 after weights. Each score is one sample per problem; model cards contain the
correct/total counts and evaluation notes.

### Perplexity

Run the fixed four-domain quick corpus through the artifact's tokenizer and Text model:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-perplexity models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --corpus eval/corpora/perplexity-1m/manifest.json \
  --quick --kv-dtype fp8
```

The evaluator reports token-weighted fixed-window causal perplexity and writes a complete JSON
record under `profiles/perplexity/`. See [Perplexity evaluation](docs/perplexity.md) for the metric,
corpus, custom-text mode, and comparison rules.

## Startup notes

GPU residency is fixed at process startup. `--spec` selects speculative decoding residency, and
`--vision` selects Vision residency. DFlash is available for text-only Qwen3.6-35B-A3B execution.

## Docker

Build the runtime image on a host with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer:local .
```

Mount the downloaded model and run the same example server profile:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --gpus '"device=0"' \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/models:ro" \
  ninfer:local \
  ninfer-serve /models/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --max-context 240000 \
  --kv-capacity 240000 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --kv-dtype fp8 \
  --device-state-slots 2 \
  --host-state-slots 8 \
  --host-kv-mib 8192 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

## Capabilities and limits

All registered model IDs support:

- text generation with thinking and non-thinking prompt modes;
- image, multi-image, video, and mixed multimodal messages;
- chunked prefill, exact-batch CUDA Graph decode, and startup-bounded batched decode;
- MTP speculative decoding with draft windows from one to five;
- BF16, INT8 group-64, and row-scaled FP8 E4M3 KV storage;
- offline causal-perplexity scoring with the same Text model and selectable KV storage;
- private and shared exact-prefix reuse with Device/Host State and KV retention;
- model-aware sampling defaults and explicit sampler overrides;
- OpenAI Responses Core, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic Messages, including streaming,
  tools, local response state, token counting, and usage accounting.

The 35B-A3B target additionally supports text-only DFlash with draft windows from one to fifteen.

The product boundary remains intentionally small:

- one RTX 5090 and one resident model per Engine;
- a startup-fixed capacity of one to eight active requests with bounded FIFO ingress;
- no request preemption, priority/QoS, active-request swapping, weight offload, multi-GPU, or
  distributed serving;
- one shared startup-fixed KV pool across active requests and retained prefixes;
- no runtime model discovery or unregistered checkpoint fallback;
- parsed tool calls are returned to the client; NInfer does not execute tools;
- the in-tree C++ headers are not distributed as an installed SDK.

`--max-context` is each sequence's logical limit. `--kv-capacity` sizes the shared Main Text KV pool
used by active requests and retained prefixes; `auto` resolves the largest legal capacity at
startup from the memory remaining after weights while keeping 1 GiB of sizing headroom. Explicit
capacities remain fixed for the process lifetime.

# Single-GPU serving performance

Published measurements use one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 through NInfer's public HTTP serving route.
Choose a model below for its detailed results, run conditions, output limitations, and reproduction
commands. These are recorded measurements; a model/backend being supported does not
mean every workload or concurrency has a published measurement.

Read the [measurement and publication rules](performance/methodology.md) for workload definitions,
metric formulas, statistics, comparison requirements, and the standard result-page format.

## Published coverage

Each cell links to the relevant result section. “Not published” describes measurement coverage,
not product support. C is configured request concurrency; K is the number of draft tokens.

Qwen3.8 and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B C=1 corpus points also supply their single-request phase tables.
The Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4 MTP3 phase table comes from a corpus C=1 point whose full makespan is
not published here. Qwen3.8 measurements use FP8 E4M3 row-256 KV; the Qwen3.6 measurements
use INT8 group-64 KV. Each model page records its build and run conditions.

Flash Next, GLM and Spark deployments have no published result page in this campaign.
Their current support is listed in the [README](../README.md#supported-models-and-deployments).
The Qwen3.8-27B measurements above describe a different architecture and artifact.
Flash Next's current execution scope is documented [here](maintainer/qwen4_exp-model.md).

## Reading the results

| Question | Metric to use |
|---|---|
| How fast is prompt processing or an individual decode phase? | Prefill phase, Server TTFT, Decode phase |
| How long does the full fixed request set take? | Corpus makespan, Corpus decode, Requests/s |
| What aggregate decode rate is sustained at a full batch? | Steady decode |

These rates use different time boundaries. Server TTFT is an internal phase sum; external
streaming TTFT has its [own benchmark contract](../tools/bench/ttft/README.md). Stochastic runs
can generate different token totals even with the same prompts and seeds. Output-limit and
repetition samples remain labeled in the measured corpus; throughput alone does not establish
successful task completion. See the [35B termination and anomalies](performance/qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md#termination-and-anomalies)
and [Qwen3.8 completion outcomes](performance/qwen3.8-27b.md#completion-outcomes).

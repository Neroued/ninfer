 *
 * `x` and `out` are same-shaped contiguous BF16 tensors, weight is contiguous BF16 [D], and eps
 * is positive and finite. Nonnegative empty shapes perform no device work. Nonempty backing is
 * naturally BF16-aligned. Input, weight, and output must not overlap.
 * Preserves inputs and writes out; no workspace or persistent state.
 *
 * The overload with inverse also writes inv_r to contiguous FP32 [ne[1],ne[2],ne[3]],
 * without the weight multiplier. For nonempty x, inverse belongs to the execution device,
 * is naturally FP32-aligned, and must not overlap x, weight, or out. Empty x performs no
 * writes to either output, including when D is zero and the trailing extents are positive.
